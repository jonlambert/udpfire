udpfire
=======

A command line tool to quickly fire UDP packets to a host. Nothing special... I created this because I was getting fed up of complex commands and scripts just to test a UDP server. 

*Usage*
```
	udpfire <host> <port> <message>
	#Â eg. udpfire 127.0.0.1 2000 "Hello, world."
```

*Installation*
```
	gem install udpfire
```
